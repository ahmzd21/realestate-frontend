## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this frontend locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/realestate-frontend.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/realestate-frontend.git)
    cd realestate-frontend
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.development` in the root of the `client` folder (where `package.json` is). This file will hold your local backend API URL.

    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
    *(Ensure your backend is running locally on port 5000)*

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port depending on your Vite configuration).

## üöÄ Deployment

This frontend application is designed to be deployed as a static site. It can be easily hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

**Key considerations for deployment:**

* **Environment Variables:** Ensure your hosting platform is configured with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointing to your deployed backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-api.onrender.com`).
* **Build Command:** `npm run build` or `yarn build`
* **Publish Directory:** `dist`
